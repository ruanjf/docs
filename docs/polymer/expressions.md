{% include toc.html %}
 
{{site.project_title}} [implements](https://github.com/polymer/polymer-expressions)
expression syntax using the [Binding Delegate API](/platform/template.html#binding-delegate-api). It enables you to use named scopes and simple inline expressions within {{site.project_title}} element {%raw%}`{{}}`{%endraw%} bindings.

## Inline expressions

{{site.project_title}} supports expressions in {%raw%}`{{}}`{%endraw%} with a strict
subset of the JavaScript language. In order to use this feature, it's
important to understand its behavior and limitations:

- The goal for inline expressions is to allow the expression of simple value
concepts and relationships. It is generally bad practice to put complex logic
into your HTML (view).
- Expressions are never run (e.g. `eval`) as page script. They cannot access any
global state (e.g. `window`). They are parsed and converted to a simple
interpreted form which is provided the present values of paths contained in
the expression.

The specific subset of JavaScript which is supported is:

| Feature | Example | Explanation
|---------|
|Identifiers & paths | `foo`, `foo.bar.baz` | These values are treated as relative to the local model, extracted, observed for changes and cause the expression to be re-evaluated if one or more has changed.
| Logical not operator | `!` |
| Unary operators | `+foo`, `-bar` | Converted to `Number`. Or converted to `Number`, then negated.
| Binary operators | `foo + bar`, `foo - bar`, `foo * bar` | Supported: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
| Comparators | `foo < bar`, `foo != bar`, `foo == bar` | Supported: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`
| Logical comparators | `foo && bar || baz` | Supported: `||`, `&&`
| Ternary operator | `a ? b : c` |
| Grouping (parenthesis) | `(a + b) * (c + d)` |
| Literal values | numbers, strings, `null`, `undefined` | Escaped strings and non-decimal numbers are not supported. |
| Array & Object initializers | `[foo, 1]`, `{id: 1, foo: bar}` |
| Labeled statements | `foo: bar.baz; bat: boo > 2;` |
{: .table }

### Unlabeled vs. labeled statements

Expressions are parsed when they're within a mustache ({% raw %}`{{}}`{% endraw %}).
The expression can be a single statement, or multiple labeled statements.

If the result is a _single unlabeled statement_, whenever the value of one or
more paths in the expression change, the value of the expression re-evaluated
and the result inserted as the value of the mustache:

{% raw %}
    <div>Jill has {{ daughter.children.length + son.children.length }} grandchildren</div>
{% endraw %}

may result in:

    <div>Jill has 100 grandchildren</div>

If the result is _one or more labeled statements_, the value of the mustache
will include the set of space-separated label identifiers whose corresponding expressions are truthy:

{% raw %}
    <div class="{{ active: user.selected; big: user.type == 'super' }}"> 
{% endraw %}

may result in:

    <div class="active big"> 

## Named scopes

Named scopes are useful for referencing a model value from an "outer" model "scope".
For example:

{% raw %}
    <template repeat="{{ user in users }}">
      {{ user.name }}
      <template repeat="{{ file in user.files }}">
        {{ user.name }} owners {{ file.name }}
      </template>
    </template>
{% endraw %}

The scope naming is available (but optional) inside the `template`, `bind`, and `repeat` directives.

{% raw %}
- `bind` syntax: `<template bind="{{ expression as identifier }}">`
- `repeat` syntax: `<template repeat="{{ identifier in expression }}">`
{% endraw %}

**Note:** that `expression` can be a simple identifier, a path or a full
expression (including Object and Array literals).
{: .alert .alert-info }

### Nested scoping rules

If a `<template>` using a named scoped contains children `<template>`s,
all ancestor scopes are visible, up-to and including the first ancestor **not** using a named scope.

{% raw %}
    <template bind="{{ foo as foo }}">
      <!-- foo.* available -->
      <template bind="{{ foo.bar as bar }}">
        <!-- foo.* & bar.* available -->
        <template bind="{{ bar.bat }}">
          <!-- only properties of bat are available -->
          <template bind="{{ boo as bot }}">
            <!-- bot.* and properties of bat are available. NOT foo.* or bar.* -->
          </template>
        </template>
      </template>
    </template>
{% endraw %}
