The {{site.project_title}} _core_ provides a thin layer of code that expresses
its opinion and provides the extra sugaring that all {{site.project_title}} elements use. It is provided in the file `polymer.js`.

**Note:** You can find working examples of the concepts on this page in [/toolkit-ui](https://github.com/polymer/toolkit-ui), [/polymer-elements](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-elements), and [/polymer-ui-elements](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-ui-elements).

## Element declaration

At the heart of {{site.project_title}} are Custom Elements. Thus, it should be no surprise that defining a {{site.project_title}} element is similar to the way you define a standard Custom Element. The major difference is that {{site.project_title}} elements are created using `<polymer-element>`, not `<element>`.

    <polymer-element name="tag-name" constructor="TagName">
      <template>
        <!-- shadow DOM here -->
      </template>
      <script>Polymer('tag-name');</script>
    </polymer-element>

**Note**: {{site.project_title}} creates [Shadow DOM](/platform/shadow-dom.html) from the first
`<template>` in the element definition.
{: .alert .alert-info}

### Alternate ways to register an element

For convenient decoupling of script and markup, you don't have to inline the JS.
{{site.project_title}} elements can be created by referencing an external script
which calls `Polymer('tag-name')`:

    <!-- 2. Script refereced inside the element definition. -->
    <polymer-element name="tag-name">
      <template>...</template>
      <script src="path/to/tagname.js"></script>
    </polymer-element>

    <!-- 3. Script comes before the element definition. -->
    <script src="path/to/tagname.js"></script>
    <polymer-element name="tag-name">
      <template>...</template>
    </polymer-element>

    <!-- 4. No script -->
    <polymer-element name="tag-name" constructor="TagName" noscript>
      <template>
        <!-- shadow DOM here -->
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

#### Imperative registration {#imperativeregister}

Elements can be registered in pure JavaScript like so:

    <script>
      Polymer('name-tag', {nameColor: 'red'});
      var el = document.createElement('div');
      el.innerHTML = '\
        <polymer-element name="name-tag" attributes="name">\
          <template>\
            Hello <span style="color:{{nameColor}}">{{name}}</span>\
          </template>\
        </polymer-element>';
      // The custom elements polyfill can't see the <polymer-element>
      // unless you put it in the DOM.
      document.body.appendChild(el);    
    </script>

    <name-tag name="John"></name-tag>

Note that you need to add the `<polymer-element>` to the document so that the 
Custom Elements polyfill picks it up.

### Adding public properties and methods {#propertiesmethods}

If you wish to define methods/properties on your element (optional), pass an object
as the second argument to `{{site.project_title}}()`. This object is used to define
the element's `prototype`.

The following example defines a property `message` and a method `foo`: 

    <polymer-element name="tag-name">
      <template>...</template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('tag-name', {
          message: "Hello!",
          foo: function() {...}
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

### Adding private or static variables {#static}

If you need private state within an element, wrap your script using standard
techniques like anonymous self-calling functions:

    <polymer-element name="tag-name">
      <template>...</template>
      <script>
        (function() {
          // Ran once. Private and static to the element.
          var foo_ = new Foo();

          // Ran for every instance of the element that's created.
          {{site.project_title}}('tag-name', {
            get foo() { return foo_; }
          });
        })();
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

### Element lifecycle methods {#lifecyclemethods}

{{site.project_title}} has first class support for the Custom Element lifecycle
callbacks, though for convenience, implements them with shorter names.

All of the lifecycle callbacks are optional: 

    {{site.project_title}}('tag-name', {
      created: function() { ... },
      enteredView: function () { ... },
      leftView: function() { ... },
      attributeChanged: function(attrName, oldVal, newVal) {
        //var newVal = this.getAttribute(attrName);
        console.log(attrName, 'old: ' + oldVal, 'new:', newVal);
      },
    });

Below is a table of the lifecycle methods according to the Custom Elements
[specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webcomponents/raw-file/tip/spec/custom/index.html#custom-element-lifecycle) vs. the names {{site.project_title}} uses.

Spec | {{site.project_title}} | Called when
|-
createdCallback | created | an instance of the element is created
enteredViewCallback | enteredView | an instance was inserted into the document
leftViewCallback | leftView | an instance was removed from the document
attributeChangedCallback | attributeChanged | an attribute was added, removed, or updated
{: .table }

### The WebComponentsReady event {#WebComponentsReady}

The polyfill(s) parse element definitions and handle their upgrade _asynchronously_. If you try to fetch the element from the DOM before things have settled, you'll get a big fat `null`. In these situations, an including page should wait for the `WebComponentsReady` event
before working with the node.

Example:

    <head>
      <link rel="import" href="path/to/x-foo.html">
    </head>
    <body style="opacity:0">
      <x-foo></x-foo>
      <script>
        window.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', function() {
          document.body.style.opacity = 1; // show body now that registration is done.

          var xFoo = document.querySelector('x-foo');
          // Do something with x-foo.
        });
      </script>
    </body>

**Tip:** Use the `WebComponentsReady` event to mitigate FOUC in browsers that don't
support the CSS `:unknown` pseudo class.

## {{site.project_title}} Features {#features}

### Published properties

When you _publish_ a property name, you're making that property two-way data-bound and part
of the element's "public API". Published properties can be initialized by an HTML attribute
of the same name. 

There are two ways to publish properties:

1. **Preferred** - Include its name in the `<polymer-element>`'s `attributes` attribute.
1. Include the name in a `publish` object on your prototype.

As an example, here's an element that publishes three public properties, `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`:

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" attributes="foo bar baz">
      <script> 
        Polymer('x-foo');
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

#### Default property values

By default, properties defined in `attributes` are `null`:

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" attributes="foo">
      <script> 
        Polymer('x-foo'); // x-foo has a foo property with null value.
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

As such, you can provide default values using the `prototype`:

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" attributes="foo">
      <script> 
        Polymer('x-foo', { // x-foo has a foo property with default value false.
          foo: false
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <!-- Same, but using the alternate "publish" object. -->
    <polymer-element name="x-foo">
      <script> 
        Polymer('x-foo', {
          publish: {
            foo: false 
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

#### Configuring an element via attributes

Attributes are a great way for users of your element to configure it, declaratively.
They can customize a published property by passing an initial value on the attribute
with the same name:

    <x-foo foo="true"></x-foo>

**Note:** As of today, property values are not reflected back into markup. Also, setting
an attribute using `.setAttribute()`) has no effect.
{: .alert }

##### Hinting an attribute's type

When attribute values are converted to property values, {{site.project_title}} attempts to convert the value to the correct type, depending on the default value of the property.

    <polymer-element name="x-foo" attributes="foo">
      <script> 
        Polymer('x-foo', {
          foo: false // hint that foo is Boolean
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

### Data binding and custom attributes

Published properties are data-bound inside of {{site.project_title}} elements and accessible
via `{%raw%}{{}}{%endraw%}`. These bindings are by reference and are two-way.

For example, we can define a `name-tag` element that publishes two properties,
`name` and `nameColor`.

    <polymer-element name="name-tag" attributes="name nameColor">
      <template>
        Hello! My name is <span style="color:{{"{{nameColor"}}}}">{{"{{name"}}}}</span>
      </template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('name-tag', {
          nameColor: "orange"
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

In this example, `name` has initial value of `null` and `nameColor` has a value of "orange".
Thus, the `<span>`'s color will be orange.

#### Binding objects to attribute values

Generally, attributes are string values, but {{site.project_title}} makes it possible to bind references between elements using attributes. The binding engine interprets reference bindings
by interrogating the [attribute's type](#hinting-an-attributes-type). This means you 
can bind an an object to an HTML attribute!

Let's modify the `name-tag` example to take an object instead of individual properties.

    <polymer-element name="name-tag" attributes="person">
      <template>
        Hello! My name is <span style="color:{{"{{person.nameColor"}}}}">{{"{{person.name"}}}}</span>
      </template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('name-tag', {
          created: function() {
            this.person = {
              name: "Scott",
              nameColor: "orange"
            }
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

Now, imagine we make a new component called `<visitor-creds>` that uses `name-tag`:

    <polymer-element name="visitor-creds">
      <template>
        <name-tag person="{{"{{person"}}}}"></name-tag>
      </template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('visitor-creds', {
          created: function() {
            this.person = {
              name: "Scott2",
              nameColor: "red"
            }
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

When an instance of `<visitor-creds>` is created, its `person` property (an object)
is also bound to `<name-tag>`'s `person` property. Now both components are using
the same `person` object.

**Important:** Be careful when your properties are objects or arrays. Element registration
is evaluated once. This means only one instance of an object used in property initialization is ever created. Because of the nature of `prototype`, you may run into unexpected "shared state" across different instances of the same element if you're setting an initial value for a property which is an object or array. Do this type of initialization in `created()` rather than directly on the `prototype`. 
{: .alert .alert-error }

### Declarative event mapping

{{site.project_title}} supports declarative binding of events to methods in the component.
It uses special <code>on-<em>event</em></code> syntax to trigger this binding behavior.

    <polymer-element name="g-cool" on-keypress="keypressHandler">
      <template>
        <button on-click="buttonClick"></button>
      </template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('g-cool', {
          keypressHandler: function(event, detail, sender) { ...},
          buttonClick: function(event, detail, sender) { ... }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

In this example, the `on-keypress` declaration maps the standard DOM `"keypress"` event to the `keypressHandler` method defined on the element. Similarly, a button witin the element
declares a `on-click` handler for click events that calls the `buttonClick` method.
All of this is achieved without the need for any glue code. 

Some things to notice:

* The value of an event handler attribute is the string name of a method on the component. Unlike traditional syntax, you cannot put executable code in the attribute.
* The event handler is passed the following arguments:
  * `inEvent` is the [standard event object](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#interface-Event).
  * `inDetail`: A convenience form of `inEvent.detail`.
  * `inSender`: A reference to the node that declared the handler. This is often different from `inEvent.target` (the lowest node that received the event) and `inEvent.currentTarget` (the component processing the event), so  {{site.project_title}} provides it directly.

### Change watchers {#change-watchers}

All properties on {{site.project_title}} elements can be watched for changes by implementing a <code><em>propertyName</em>Changed</code> handler. When the value of a watched property changes, the appropriate change handler is automatically invoked. 

    <polymer-element name="g-cool" attributes="better best">
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('g-cool', {
          plain: '',
          best: '',
          betterChanged: function(inOldValue) {
          },
          bestChanged: function(inOldValue) {
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

In this example, there are two watched properties, `better` and `best`. The `betterChanged` and `bestChanged` function will be called whenever `better` or `best` are modified, respectively. 

### Automatic node finding

Another useful feature of {{site.project_title}} is node reference marshalling. Every node in a component's shadow DOM that is tagged with an `id` attribute is automatically referenced in the component's `this.$` hash. 

For example, the following defines a component whose template contains an `<input>` element whose `id` attribute is `nameInput`. The component can refer to that element with the expression `this.$.nameInput`.

    <polymer-element name="x-form">
      <template>
        <input type="text" id="nameInput">
      </template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('x-form', {
          logNameValue: function() {
            console.log(this.$.nameInput.value);
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

### Extending other elements

A {{site.project_title}} element can extend another element by using the `extends`
attribute. The parent's properties and methods are inherited by the child element
and data-bound.

    <polymer-element name="polymer-cool">
      <!-- UI-less element -->
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('polymer-cool', {
          praise: 'cool'
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <polymer-element name="polymer-cooler" extends="polymer-cool">
      <template>
        {%raw%}{{praise}}{%endraw%} <!-- "cool" -->
      </template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('polymer-cooler');
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

#### Overriding a parent's methods

When you override an inherited method, you can call the parent's method with `this.super()`.

    <polymer-element name="polymer-cool">
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('polymer-cool', {
          praise: 'cool',
          makeCoolest: function() {
            this.praise = 'coolest';
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <polymer-element name="polymer-cooler" extends="polymer-cool" on-click="makeCoolest">
      <template>polymer-cooler is {%raw%}{{praise}}{%endraw%}</template>
      <script>
        {{site.project_title}}('polymer-cooler', {
          praise: 'cooler',
          makeCoolest: function() {
            this.super(); // calls polymer-cool's makeCoolest()
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <polymer-cooler></polymer-cooler>

In this example, when the user clicks on a `<polymer-cooler>` element, its
`makeCoolest()` method is called, which in turn calls the parent's version
using `this.super()`. The `praise` property (inherited from `<polymer-cool>`) is set
to "coolest".

## Advanced utilities {#additional-utilities}

- [`async()`](#asyncmethod)
- [`fire()` / `asyncFire()`](#fire)
- [`unbindAll()` / `cancelUnbindAll()` / `asyncUnbindAll()`](#bindings)

### Dealing with asynchronous tasks {#asyncmethod}

Many things in {{site.project_title}} happen asynchronously. Changes are gathered up
and executed all at once, instead of executing right away. Batching
changes creates an optimization that (a) prevents duplicated work and (b) reduces unwanted [FOUC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content).

[Change watchers](#change-watchers) and situations that rely on data-bindings
are examples that fit under this async behavior. For example, conditional templates may not immediately render after setting properties because changes to those renderings are saved up and performed all at once after you return from JavaScript.

To do work after changes have been processed, {{site.project_title}} provides `async()`.
It's similar to `window.setTimeout()`, but automatically binds `this` to the correct value:

    // async(inMethod, inArgs, inTimeout)
    this.async(function() {
      this.foo = 3;
    }, null, 1000);

    // Roughly equivalent to:
    //setTimeout(function() {
    //  this.foo = 3;
    //}.bind(this), 1000);

The first argument is a function or string name for the method to call asynchronously.
The second argument, `inArgs`, is an optional object or array of arguments to
pass to the callback.

In the case of property changes that result in DOM modifications, follow this pattern:

    Polymer('my-element', {
      propChanged: function() {
        // If "prop" changing results in our DOM changing, schedule an update after
        // the new microtask.
        this.async(this.updateValues);
      },
      updateValues: function() {...}
    });

### Firing custom events {#fire}

{{site.project_title}} core provides a convenient `fire()` method for
sending custom events. Essentially, it's a wrapper around your standard `node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(...))`. In cases where you need to fire an event after microtasks have completed,
use the asynchronous version: `asyncFire()`.

Example:

    <polymer-element name="ouch-button">
      <template>
        <button on-click="onClick">Send hurt</button> 
      </template>
      <script>
        Polymer('ouch-button', {
          onClick: function() {
            this.fire('ouch', {msg: 'That hurt!'}); // fire(inType, inDetail, inToNode)
          }
        });
      </script>
    </polymer-element>

    <ouch-button></ouch-button>

    <script>
      document.querySelector('ouch-button').addEventListener('ouch', function(e) {
        console.log(e.type, e.detail.msg); // "ouch" "That hurt!"
      });
    </script>

**Tip:** If your element is within another {{site.project_title}} element, you can
use the special [`on-* handlers`](#declarative-event-mapping) to deal with the event: `<ouch-button on-ouch="myMethod"></ouch-button>`
{: .alert .alert-success }

### Life of an element's bindings {#bindings}

**Note:** The section only applies to elements that are instantiated in JavaScript, not to those
declared in markup.
{: .alert .alert-info }

If you instantiate an element (e.g. `document.createElement('x-foo')`) and do **not** add it to the DOM,
{{site.project_title}} asynchronously removes its {%raw%}`{{}}`{%endraw%} bindings and `*Changed` methods.
This helps prevent memory leaks, ensuring the element will be garbage collected. 

If you want the element to "remain active" when it's not in the `document`,
call `cancelUnbindAll()` right after you create or remove it. The [lifecycle methods](#lifecyclemethods)
are a good place for this:

    Polymer('my-element', {
      created: function() {
        // Ensure bindings remain active, even if we're never added to the DOM.
        this.cancelUnbindAll();
      },
      leftDocument: function() {
        // Also keep bindings active if we're added, but later removed.
        this.cancelUnbindAll();
      }
    });

{{site.project_title}} typically handles this management for you, but when you
explicitly call `cancelUnbindAll()` (and the element is never added to/put back in the DOM),
it becomes your responsibility to _eventually_ unbind the element using `unbindAll()/asyncUnbindAll()`:

    var el = document.createElement('my-element');
    // Need to unbind if el is:
    //   1. never added to the DOM
    //   2. put in the DOM, but later removed
    el.unbindAll();

Otherwise, your application will leak memory.
